# About this assignment
We had to implement a menu-driven console application with some given functionalities.

The functionalities I chose:
* Check for the largest sequence with strictly increasing numbers
* Check for the largest sequence whose numbers have different signs
* Check for the largest sequence that contains at most 3 distinct values
* Check for the largest sequence which elements have sum equal to 10
    
### Requirements (the exact problem statement)
Implement a menu-driven console application that provides the following functionalities:
1. Read a list of integers from the keyboard.
2. Print the entire list of numbers.
3. Print to console the longest sequence that observes a given property. Each student will receive
2 of the properties from the list provided below.
4. Exit the application.
The application will have a documentation that contains:
* Running scenarios for the requirements at point 3 above.
* Test cases for the requirements at point 3 in the form of a table

The sequence consists of:
1. Strictly increasing numbers.
2. Contains at most 3 distinct values.
3. All consecutive number pairs have the greatest common divisor 1.
4. Contains only prime numbers.
5. A single number.
6. Distinct numbers.
7. The difference between the absolute value of consecutive numbers is a prime number.
`(e.g. 1 3 10 21)`
8. All elements are in the [0, 10] range.
9. Differences between consecutive number pairs have different signs.
`(e.g. 1 3 2 10 5)`
10. Consecutive numbers have different signs.
`(e.g. 1 -2 3 -5 10 -99)`
11. Sum of its elements is 10
12. All consecutive number pairs have at least 2 common digits.
`(e.g. 12 2213 31 314 451)`
13. Is in the form of a mountain (first the values increase, then they decrease).
`(e.g. 1 2 4 90 80 76 43 3)`
14. fWriting them in base 10 is done using the same digits.
`(e.g. 1 3 31 331 111 11313)`
